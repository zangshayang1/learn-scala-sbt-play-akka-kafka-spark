/*
  In Kafka, each consumer belongs to a particular group.
  --------------------------------------------------
  Why is it important?
  Well, unlike traditional messaging systems, Kafka doesnâ€™t delete events that have been consumed.
  Instead, after a consumer from one particular group consumes a message, it shifts the message offset for its group.
  The message offsets for other groups will remain untouched until they consume the same message and shift the offset as well.

  This allows to have multiple subscribers that see all events and process them independently from each other.
  In our scenario, it makes sense to create two consumers
    - LogRecordConsumer and TagEventConsumer.

  The first one will belong to the log group and subscribe to all known topics.
    That's why topicName is a Set of Strings.
  The second one will subscribe to the tag topic and belong to the read group.
