### install node version manager
> brew install nvm

Setup includes: export NVM_DIR and activate nvm.sh.
Please refer to sys.built for details.

### initiate frontend project
> npm init

A package.json file will be created to collect dependencies. So when you install dependencies like this: "> npm i react". It will automatically be written down in package.json.
The dependencies will be installed under node_modules dir.


## Webpack

Developers will create multiple JS modules and reference them across all the webpages.

This is when webpack comes in as a bundler which:
1. combines all the JS modules in ui
2. produces a single bundle.js
3. stores it in public/compiled dir as static resources for browser to use.

webpack.config.js file in the root dir specify the above 3 points.

### prepare ui dir to store frontend source code
> mkdir ui

### prepare public/compiled for webpack
> mkdir public/compiled

### enable interaction with webpack in terminal
Add the following line to package.file under "script" section:
"watch": "webpack --watch"
