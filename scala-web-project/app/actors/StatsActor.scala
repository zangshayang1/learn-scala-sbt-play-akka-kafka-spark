/*
For our task, we will need three messages.
During the start-up phase,
the application start-up code will send a Ping message to the actor.

The Ping itself doesnâ€™t do anything other than ensures that
the actor is started and ready to accept other messages.

When a new request comes,
the StatsFilter will send another message called RequestReceived.

The StatsActor reacts to this message by incrementing the counter.

Finally, the Application controller can send a message called GetStats,
and the actor will respond by sending the current value of the counter back.

In addition to these three messages,
the actor needs a name and path.
The name is used during the creation of an actor,
and the path is used for obtaining a reference to it.
